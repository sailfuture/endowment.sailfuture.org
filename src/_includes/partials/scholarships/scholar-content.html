            <p>The SailFuture Academy is a tuition-free private high school for St. Peteâ€™s most at-risk students. 
              <br></br>
              We have secured a $2M matching gift to kickstart the endowment, and if the average gift of everyone reading this email were $25,000, we would reach our goal overnight. If desired, gift commitments can be spread out over three separate yearly payments.

              Our curriculum breaks the mold of traditional schooling, and includes paid internships and apprenticeships, an entrepreneurship hub and business thesis experience, round-the-world sailing expeditions, integrated life skills and counseling, and truly multidisciplinary project-based learning.

              <br></br>
              The creation of an endowment ensures the sustainability of a tuition-free, exceptional education for generations to come. It relieves the burden of annual fundraising in such a way that allows our dedicated team to focus their efforts on quality and expansion.
